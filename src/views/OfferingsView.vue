                    <h2>What I offer</h2>

                    <div>I offer 3 different kinds of sessions:</div>
                    <div>Further information about each modality I integrate can be found below.</div>

                    <h3>Somatic Experiencing (Virtual and In-Person):</h3>

                    <p>In Somatic Experiencing, we learn to connect with the way the body communicates through sensation. Rather than only speaking the story of events that have affected us, we make space for the felt story of the body. I educate my clients about how their nervous system works and the way that survival responses can get stuck in the physiology.</p>
                    <p>Then, in a slow, gentle way, we explore ways of helping the body process and resolve what it is holding. We make space for increased resilience, so that we can move through each day with less discomfort and more support from the inside out.</p>
                    <p>We may also use Reiki to support the body if there is overwhelm, or to integrate the Somatic Experiencing work.</p>

                    <h3>Somatic Voice (Virtual Only):</h3>

                    <p>In Somatic Voice sessions, we explore the therapeutic experience of singing. These sessions are perfect for people who have never had voice lessons before, but want to befriend their voice, or for those with prior voice training who are seeking something more trauma-informed.</p>
                    <p>For some, voice work can be vulnerable and bring up emotion, and in some cases, be linked with stress and trauma the body has experienced. These sessions are a space where the emotions and body sensations are welcome. Part of the process of finding the most joyful and easeful expression of the voice, is to support the stuff that comes up around singing (i.e. anxiety, shame, fear, sadness, relief, play, hope etc.). Somatic Voice is holistic in practice. The entire person is respected in the process of connecting with the voice.</p>

                    <h3>Trauma-Informed Reiki (Virtual and In-Person):</h3>

                    <p>Trauma-Informed Reiki sessions incorporate Somatic Experiencing with Reiki. These sessions include noticing sensations and emotions the body is holding and then entering into the Reiki practice with intention to help the body process, rest, and receive care. Depending on the session, we may communicate verbally during the Reiki portion, or if the client chooses, we might practice quietly or with guided visualization and then take time to process the session with somatic language afterwards.</p>

                    <h2>Somatic Experiencing (SE™)</h2>
                    <img alt="A leather-bound book opened in the middle with the top of the pages showing in gold. The book has a satiny bookmark in its open page with blurred grass in the background." loading="lazy" src="../assets/images/open_book.webp">

                    <p>Somatic Experiencing (SE™) is a “body-oriented therapeutic model for healing trauma and stress. It is based on a multidisciplinary intersection of physiology, psychology, ethology, biology, neuroscience, indigenous healing practices, and medical biophysics and has been clinically applied for more than four decades. It is the life’s work of Dr. Peter A. Levine.”</p>

                    <p>In my personal experience, SE has empowered me to create a deep relationship with my body and to trust and care for myself in new ways. <b>By learning how to listen more deeply, patterns of trauma and overwhelm find their way toward softening and resolution.</b></p>

                    <p>Our capacity for connection with others becomes more engaged. We experience more of what it feels like to be alive and develop an environment of curiosity for the experiences of our body. <b>With increased resilience, we can find ways to move through each day's inevitable challenges with less discomfort and more support from the inside out.</b></p>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Reiki</h3>
                    <p>I combine Reiki with Somatic Experiencing as a tool for supporting the nervous system. Reiki is a form of hands-on (or distance) energy healing that originated in Japan, that brings relief from suffering and supports overall health.</p>

                    <p>Reiki can be used to work with physical pain, emotional distress and grief. It is also useful in tapping into our intuition and felt sense of the body and is an empowering practice of trusting in our bodies innate capacity to heal. Reiki can be used in my sessions in-person or remotely. During the Reiki portion of the practice (should the client choose) we may continue to be in dialogue or use this part of the session as a quiet time for the nervous system to integrate the SE work.</p>

                    <p><b>In my personal experience, Reiki is a soft place to land. It provides an opportunity to listen to the body and connect with a sense of safety and being supported, which is helpful for trauma resolution work.</b></p>

            <section id="voice">

                    <a class="chevron-link" href="#reiki"></a>
                    <h3>Voice</h3>
                    <p>Connecting with the voice can be a powerful tool in working with stress and trauma. We may make contact with the voice through humming, sighing, and for those who are interested, singing. <b>Working with the voice in an empowered way can be particularly effective for those whose voices have ever felt stifled.</b></p>

                    <p><b>For me, the voice practices I use on a daily basis help me to create a sense of space inside my body. With trauma, a lack of space inside (tension in the muscles, fascia, viscera etc.) often causes a lot of discomfort.</b> Being able to free my voice (with no expectation of how it sounds) has been a foundational part of my healing journey.</p>

            <section class="primary" id="movement-yoga">
                <div class="section-wrapper">
                    <a class="chevron-link primary" href="#reiki"></a>
                    <h3>Movement/Yoga</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes when we feel stuck, it proves useful to listen to how our bodies would like to move. <b>In times of overwhelm, movement can be a powerful tool that we can do almost anywhere to help our body regulate.</b> We may explore using movement in our sessions to help feel sensation and release tension. For those for whom Yoga is a supportive practice, we may also use Yoga postures to create spaciousness or practice working with activation.</p>

                    <p>In my experience, movement practice can be a wonderful medicine. It is particularly useful in that it is a constant tool we carry with us throughout our days. <b>I believe in empowering my clients to be in relationship with their bodies' innate healing wisdom through their everyday movement outside of sessions if they feel comfortable.</b></p>
